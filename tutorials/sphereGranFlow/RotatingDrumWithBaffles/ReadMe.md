# Problem Definition 
The problem is to simulate a Rotating Drum with **6** Baffles with the diameter **0.24m** and the length **0.1m** rotating at **15 rad/s**. This Rotating Drum is filled with **20000** Particles.The timestep for integration is **0.00001 s**. There are 2 types of Particles in this Rotating Drum:
* **12500** Particles with **4 mm** diameter
* **7500** Particles with **5mm** diameter  
## Setting up the Case
As it has been explained in the previous Cases, these Tutorials are based on text-based scripts. There are three parts in this case to study `caseSetup`, `setting` and `stl`.
